## PERSONAL STATEMENT

你好，我叫 Lincyaw, 你也可以叫我 Eden。我目前就读于哈尔滨工业大学（深圳），专业是计算机科学与技术。

> Hi, my name is Lincyaw, or you can call me Eden, and I am currently studying at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), majoring in Computer Science and Technology.

最近，我对分布式相关的技术比较感兴趣。在做 Mit 6.824 课程的实验，学习 Raft 算法的原理以及实现。我发现在我接触了 go 技术栈之后，我逐渐地从单机的开发环境迁移到了一个分布式的开发环境。或者说，go 技术栈天生就是为了分布式、云原生、微服务设计的。我也逐渐了解了系统设计方面的一些知识，从原本单机环境下的操作系统到现在的无数个节点连接成的“分布式操作系统”（我认为像 kubenetes 这样的调度管理的组件被称为广义上的操作系统）。

> Recently, I have been interested in technologies related to distribution. I was doing a lab for Mit 6.824 course to learn the principles and implementation of the Raft algorithm. I found that after I was introduced to the go technology stack, I gradually migrated from a standalone development environment to a distributed development environment. Or rather, the go technology stack is inherently designed for distributed, cloud-native, microservices. I also gradually learned about system design, from the original standalone operating system to the current "distributed operating system" with countless nodes connected (I think scheduling management components like kubenetes are referred to as a generalized operating system).

我觉得这些东西很有意思。但不得不面对的一个问题是，我快要毕业了。我不得不花相当一部分的时间在考虑未来上，包括秋招、毕设、出国等等。如果我为了应对这些事情，而赶进度（比如我在做实验的时候大量地借鉴别人的代码）那对于我自己的成长是不利的，相当于浪费了这些时间。

> I find these things very interesting. But one of the problems I had to face is that I am about to graduate. I have to spend a considerable part of my time thinking about my future, including fall recruitment, my final project, going abroad, etc. If I'm rushing to cope with these things (for example, I'm borrowing a lot from other people's code when I'm doing experiments) it's not good for my own growth and amounts to a waste of that time.

希望我能够把这些事情平衡好，能够有属于自己的时间来做自己喜欢的事。

> Hopefully, I can balance these things and have time to myself to do what I love.
